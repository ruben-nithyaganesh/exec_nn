using python, generate a nueral network and saves it's parameters: python linear.py
then, in C load these parameters generate an 'executable' that will perform the linear layer operation: ./linear
then build the generated executable function (might take a bit of time): ./build\_linear\_exec.sh
finally, run the executable providing an output file to compare: ./execute\_nn linear\_out.txt
